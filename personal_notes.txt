Steps:
1. README.md, .gitignore, setup.py, requirememnts.txt, and src folder
2. Inside src >> __init__.py, then components folder
3. Inside components >> __init__.py, data_injection.py, data_transformation.py, model_trainer.py, then pipeline folder
4. Inside pipeline >> __init__.py, train_pipeline.py, predict_pipeline.py
5. Inside src >> logger.py, exception.py, utils.py
